# Business-Process-Optimization-for-a-Retail-Store-Business-Analyst

Analyze and improve the sales and inventory process of a retail store to reduce costs and increase efficiency. I conducted stakeholder interviews to gather requirements and identify pain points. Used process mapping tools (Lucidchart) to map out current and optimized processes. Performed a cost-benefit analysis to justify the recommendations. Prepared a business case and present my findings.
